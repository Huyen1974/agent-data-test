ANDON: Head branch 'null' does not match pattern '^feat/merge-to-laws$'.

Current Analysis:
  • Actual branch: null
  • Expected pattern: ^feat/merge-to-laws$
  • Match result: FAILED

Guidance:
 - Prefer aligning branch naming in future integration PRs to avoid history drift.
 - If a remote head branch still exists, consider closing/renaming safely via a follow-up PR.
 - This indicates the PR was merged with non-standard branch naming.

Impact:
 - This is a compliance violation per Repo/Branch rules (§2)
 - Future PRs should follow the naming convention
