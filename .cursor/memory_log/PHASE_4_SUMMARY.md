### ID 4.1: Prometheus Metrics Exporter
- Integrated `prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator` to expose a live `/metrics` endpoint on the Cloud Run service.

### ID 4.2: Cloud Monitoring Dashboard
- Created a monitoring dashboard via Terraform to visualize key service metrics (request count, latency).

### ID 4.3: Budget Alerts
- Established an automated budget alert system via Terraform, configured to trigger at 50%, 80%, and 100% of the defined budget.

### ID 4.4: Docker Image Vulnerability Scan
- Integrated the Trivy scanner into the `build.yml` workflow to automatically scan for `CRITICAL` and `HIGH` severity vulnerabilities in the Docker image.

## Final State
- The project now has a foundational observability stack (metrics, dashboards, alerts) and an enhanced security posture with automated vulnerability scanning.
