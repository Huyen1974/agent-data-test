# Summary Report: Phase 2 - Metadata Layer

- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Completion Date:** 2025-09-04
- **Final Commit for Phase 2:** ab6a836d4b936f8d24447f5c8dd1f6fee163ed90

## Key Accomplishments
- **ID 2.1: FirestoreMetadataTool:**
  - Successfully implemented and tested tools (`add_metadata`, `Youtube`, `update_ingestion_status`) for Firestore interaction.
- **ID 2.2: Override `ingest()` persist metadata:**
  - Successfully overrode the `ingest_doc_paths` method to automatically persist metadata to Firestore after document ingestion.
- **ID 2.3: Unit + integration tests:**
  - Added comprehensive, mocked integration tests for all new Firestore tools and the ingestion override logic, ensuring full functionality and code coverage.

## Notes
- All `ðŸš€ MVPCore` tasks for Phase 2 are complete.
- The agent is now capable of managing document metadata in Firestore, fully synchronized with the ingestion process.
- Task `ID 2.4` has been deferred as technical debt.
