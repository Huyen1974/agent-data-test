# Summary Report: Phase 3 - Serverless & Gateway

- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Completion Date:** 2025-09-04
- **Final Commit for Phase 3:** 8920b1e3ae7c198b5f3feddb729fd49ce0d6aa3a

## Key Accomplishments

### ID 3.1: FastAPI Wrapper
- **Standardized API:** Refactored `agent_data/server.py` into two distinct, single-responsibility endpoints: `/ingest` for document processing and `/chat` for conversation.
- **Pydantic Models:** Implemented `ChatMessage` and `ChatResponse` models to ensure a strong, validated API contract.
- **Unit Tests:** Created `tests/test_server.py` with comprehensive, mocked unit tests for all new endpoints, maintaining high code coverage.

### ID 3.2 & 3.3: Cloud Run Deployment & Hardening
- **Preflight Checks:** Created `scripts/preflight_check.py` to validate the deployment environment.
- **Containerization:** Implemented a multi-stage `Dockerfile` for building a lean, production-ready application image.
- **Automated CI/CD:**
    - Created a dedicated `build.yml` workflow to automatically build the Docker image and push it to the standard **Google Artifact Registry** repository.
    - Created a `deploy.yml` workflow that triggers after a successful build to automatically deploy the image to **Google Cloud Run**.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Used Terraform to create the official Artifact Registry repository, ensuring infrastructure consistency.
- **Hardening:** All fallback logic and mock implementations were removed from the CI workflows and server code, resulting in a true production-ready deployment pipeline.

## Final State
- The project now has a complete, automated CI/CD pipeline.
- Pushing code to the `main` branch automatically triggers a build and deployment to a live Cloud Run service.
- All CI warnings have been resolved, and the pipeline uses standardized, constitution-compliant resource paths.
