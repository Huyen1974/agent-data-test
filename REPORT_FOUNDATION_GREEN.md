**Status:** ✅ ALL GREEN

## 📊 Checkpoint Status CP0.*

| Checkpoint | Status | Description |
|:-----------|:-------|:------------|
| **CP0.1** | ✅ PASS | Lockfile consistency (pip-compile --no-upgrade) |
| **CP0.2** | ✅ PASS | Pre-commit hooks (black, ruff, trufflehog, manifest drift) |
| **CP0.3** | ✅ PASS | Unit tests with coverage ≥ 80% |
| **CP0.4** | ✅ PASS | Manifest drift = 0 (test count frozen) |
| **CP0.5** | ✅ PASS | Secret scan 0 findings (TruffleHog v3.51.0 clean) |
| **CP0.9** | ✅ PASS | Pin dependencies (langroid==0.58.0, slowapi==0.1.9, redis>=5.0.1,<6.0.0) |

## 🔧 Implementation Completed

### Secret Scanning (CP0.5) - Step 0.5a
- ✅ Created `.trufflehogignore` with regex patterns for excludes
- ✅ Added TruffleHog to pre-commit hooks (local execution with fallback)
- ✅ Integrated secret-scan job in CI after terraform-plan step
- ✅ Updated README.md with TruffleHog setup documentation
- ✅ Removed dummy values from terraform.tfvars to prevent false positives

### Checkpoint Runner Gate
- ✅ Created `scripts/checkpoint_runner.py` (reuse C1 pattern)
- ✅ Updated `.github/workflows/lint-only.yml` with checkpoint gate job
- ✅ Enhanced `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with commit-msg stage for manifest-drift

### Alignment with 0.5b Requirements
- ✅ Hook manifest-drift local: stages [pre-commit, commit-msg]
- ✅ Gate blocks merge when any CP0.* ≠ PASS
- ✅ CI dependency version verification integrated
- ✅ Secret scanning prevents commit of sensitive data

## 📋 Sprint S1 Checklist

- [x] **Repo & CI Green:** All CP0.* checkpoints pass
- [x] **Dependency Pinning:** Langroid 0.58.0 verified compatible
- [x] **Test Foundation:** Unit tests ≥ 80% coverage maintained
- [x] **Security:** Secret scan clean, no vulnerabilities, TruffleHog integrated
- [x] **Quality Gates:** Pre-commit hooks enforced locally and in CI

## 🚀 Next Steps

**Ready for Plan V12 ID 0.5b (hook manifest-drift local)**

The foundation is now solid with all critical checkpoints green. The codebase is ready to proceed with:
- Manifest drift hook local implementation
- Golden fixtures preparation
