    "response": "Vector embeddings are numerical representations of text, images, or other data that capture semantic meaning in high-dimensional space.\n\n**Core Concepts:**\n- Transform discrete data into continuous vector representations\n- Similar items have similar vector representations in embedding space\n- Enable mathematical operations on semantic content\n\n**Semantic Search Applications:**\n- Query and document vectors compared for relevance\n- Cosine similarity commonly used for text similarity\n- Dense retrieval systems outperform traditional keyword matching\n\n**Similarity Calculations:**\n- Cosine similarity: measures angle between vectors\n- Euclidean distance: measures geometric distance\n- Dot product: combines magnitude and direction\n\n**Dimensionality Reduction:**\n- PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for linear reduction\n- t-SNE for visualization of high-dimensional data\n- UMAP for preserving local and global structure\n- Helps reduce computational complexity while preserving semantic relationships",
