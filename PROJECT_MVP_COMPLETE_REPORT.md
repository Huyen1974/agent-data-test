## Summary of Accomplishments
This document marks the successful completion of all core (`ðŸš€ MVPCore`) development tasks outlined in the "Agent Data Langroid Fw â€“ Plan V12.docx".

The project has delivered a functional, end-to-end knowledge management agent with the following key capabilities:
- **Core RAG Agent:** A robust agent built on Langroid, capable of Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
- **GCS Integration:** Ingests documents from Google Cloud Storage.
- **Metadata Management:** Manages document metadata in Firestore, synchronized with the ingestion process.
- **Long-term Memory:** Remembers conversation history using a custom Firestore backend.
- **A2A Communication:** Can receive and process tasks from other agents via Pub/Sub.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** A complete, automated pipeline for building, testing, and deploying the agent to Google Cloud Run.
- **Observability:** Foundational monitoring stack with metrics, dashboards, and budget alerts.
- **Security:** Hardened with vulnerability scanning (Trivy) and strict CI quality gates.

All development phases (0 through 5) for the MVP are now complete and verified. Remaining `Hardening` and `FutureScale` tasks have been logged as technical debt for future sprints.
